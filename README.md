# Android M-PESA SDK [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/twigaeng/android-mpesa-sdk/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/twigaeng/android-mpesa-sdk/tree/master)
This is a simple Android M-PESA SDK to allow you to integrate Safaricom M-PESA API dubbed Daraja with your Android App with ease. 
> This version only offers the STKPush Support

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up this library easily on your current project and working in no time. You only need a few configurations to start working!

## Setting Up
To be able to use the following library, you will need to add the following gradle dependency in your build.gradle(module:app) file

```gradle
dependencies {
 Â implementation 'com.twigafoods.daraja:mpesa-daraja:0.0.1'
}
```

That is the basic set up needed to be able to use the library in your applications! Daraja requires minSdkVersion Level 16 

## Permissions
If you are using this Library, this means your Application is using Internet, so don't forget the following permission also:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

That's it, you have set up the required permissions and ready to go!

## How do I use Daraja?

Simple use cases with Daraja will look something like this:

```java
//For Sandbox Mode
Daraja.with(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, Env.SANDBOX);

//For Production Mode
Daraja.with(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, Env.PRODUCTION);
```
This initializes Daraja and also generates a `Token` to be used for further requests. This should be done in your Application `onCreate Method`, to allow Daraja generate the Authorization Token as early as possible.

With the Token generated, we can now request an STKPush with ease. Just call the sendSTKPush as shown here:

```java
//For Sandbox Mode
 Daraja.sendSTKPush(
                Env.SANDBOX,
                BUSINESS_SHORT_CODE,
                PASS_KEY,
                AMOUNT,
                PARTY_A,
                PARTY_B,
                PHONE_NUMBER,
                CALLBACK_URL,
                ACCOUNT_REFERENCE,
                TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION
        );

//For Production Mode
 Daraja.sendSTKPush(
                Env.PRODUCTION,
                BUSINESS_SHORT_CODE,
                PASS_KEY,
                AMOUNT,
                PARTY_A,
                PARTY_B,
                PHONE_NUMBER,
                CALLBACK_URL,
                ACCOUNT_REFERENCE,
                TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION
        );
```

This sanitizes all the data, as required by Safaricom before making a request for the STKPush. You only need to pass the parameters and Daraja will do the rest!
